# Mouse Jiggler
a simple mouse mover using an Adafruit Trinkey QT2040

### Use Case: 
Plug the Trinkey into your USB. It acts as a mouse and moves your pointer in little circles.

### General Approach
I used the Arduino IDE and a small bit of C++ code. Similar to the 
[Tom's Hardware Mouse Jiggler article](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/diy-mouse-jiggler-raspberry-pi-pico)
except the main benefit using this alternate non-Python approach is that the device does not need to show up as
a USB storage device. (Some corporations prevent or monitor USB storage)
